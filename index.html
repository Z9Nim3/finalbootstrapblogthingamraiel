   <p class="text-muted">Quaint little restraunt tucked inside a by- lane of juhu . Blink and you will miss the entrance to the cafe . So be alert enough to spot the black signboard that says "prithvi cafe" while you are on the main road . The restraunt has a reasonably good menu with reasonable prices . </p>

  <p>Where to begin, where to begin! You know a movie is outstanding when the end credits alone are more epic than the majority of films released in the last 20 years! This film is the pure definition of an emotional roller coaster and throughout it's run time brings about fascination, humor, sadness, incredible excitement, and sheer finality. This is not your typical superhero movie and some viewers used to the entertaining, nonstop action style of the previous films may be disappointed, but I think that this movie brilliantly satisfies and subverts expectations. The film's storytelling is some of the best ever seen in blockbuster filmaking, combining smart writing, intimate character moments, and exceptional world building to create one of the best blockbuster stories ever. The superheroes are all brilliantly acted and well written, with Robert Downey Jr, Scarlett Johannson, and Chris Evans in particular turning in some of the most human and enduring acting preformances I have ever seen. In addition, Josh Brolin once again proves utterly breathtaking as Thanos, and he somehow feels even more intimidating and horribly insane than he was in Infinity War. Further proving that Thanos is definitely among the very best movie villains of the last century. The action is honestly some of the finest in the history of cinema. The world renowned final battle of this film is riveting, heartbreaking, awe inspiring, and exceptionally well choreographed. Never before have I been so thoroughly moved and elated while watching a battle scene in film. The film's soundtrack is also one of the best of it's kind and brilliantly complements the action. It is filled with some of the most stunning, blood pumping, and epic music themes you will EVER hear. And while the time travel elements (as with all time travel movies) are certainly questionable, as long as you don't spend a week thinking about them they most likely will not bother you. This is my favorite movie of all time (yes I do watch other movies too) and I don't think anything will ever top the experience of watching this movie opening night in the theatre. However even upon second viewings the film remains an utter blast to watch with tons of replay value due to the many eastereggs to previous films. Smart, beautiful, epic, and timeless this is a superhero masterpiece!.</p>

    <p>"The Lion King" has been one of my favorite Disney animated films, so I was nervous about seeing Jon Favreau's remake. Surprisingly, from beginning to end, I found myself consistently enjoying this remake more than the original, and I had no problem with it. This remake absorbed my attention with it's astounding, dazzling visuals, and this is the only Disney lifelike remake that has no humans, and animals are my passion. Jon Favreau and his crew pulled it off so well, and how on earth did they do it? Let me explain: When it comes to the craftsmanship, it is an incredible technical achievement; in beats, we all knew it has the same story, but as you are watching it, you are wondering how the filmmaking techniques will execute the same story differently, and I did not expect much at all. Jon Favreau displays his best direction here due to his effective and persistent timing and cadence. Not to mention that he has showcased the movie's heart that is in the perfect place, because of how well he handles the tone. The screenplay by Jeff Nathanson grabs my attention with the dynamic movements of the camera, and speaking of "camera," the gorgeous cinematography by Caleb Deschanel is always gripping with nicely illustrated imagery. "The Lion King" is not only a visually stunning marvel, but also a well-wrought spectacle, because of how vivid, elaborate, and how arresting it is. The filmmakers have reverence by embracing everything that made the original so special, and amplified this remake with realism, more details, skillful filmmaking on display, and depth to the themes and even to the characters. The conservative themes here feel more reactionary than the original; it is injected with military implications and some political dialogue. The effects team brought this movie to life with virtual reality tools teamed with "Unity" to create photorealistic backgrounds with tangible details, and they've made the animals incredibly realistic with animalistic precision. I was also very entertained by the fact that the filmmakers accepted the authentic animal behaviors with body language and no facial expressions, because most animals including big cast don't emote through facial expressions. This film would be an introduction of CGI for kids, but parents have to check in with them first. The filmmakers cut out the anteaters, and used aardvarks and other African animals that families have never knew before. The way Hans Zimmer remade the score is fantastic with more notes, different themes, and more instruments. The new song "Spirit" is a brilliant fit for the film. The entire star-studded cast is pitch-perfect for their characters with effective delivery. And I must add that with gestures and voice-acting, the interactions between these creature characters are palpable. JD McCrary (young) and Donald Glover (adult) are emotionally involving as Simba. Beyonce as Nala is incredibly fitting. Alfre Woodard has fierce authority for voicing Sarabi. John Oliver is so amusing as the energetic Zazu. Timon and Pumbaa here are a hilarious silly gay couple; Billy Eichner is snarky as Timon, and Seth Rogan uses his hysterical energy as Pumbaa. James Earl Jones returns as Mufasa; sounding wise, warm, and old yet capable of using authority. Chewitel Ejiofer is dramatically haunting as the sinister Scar. Scar is portrayed differently here as a brooding and manipulative dictator of wrath, greed, and lust. And lets not forget that the hyenas are dangerously realistic. Highly Recommended for the entire family (suitable for ages eight and up).</p>
